Angular is declarative programming ..compare to javascript which is imperative programming

custom  elements in angular are called directives and components


Angular 2

1) Better Performance
2) Easier to use
3) Furture proof with ES6(Ecma Script)
4) Using emerging  Web Standards like web components
5) No two way binding
6) A lot of new syntax
crap :: it is so different and so new that you can give it a new name perpendicular ::
crap :: Angular 2 has a huge learning curve just like Angular 1 but it will be much easier to use once u get the concepts
7) TypeScript will be new default language of Angular 2
  a) angular 2 is written in typescript which means
  b) we get compile time checking , autocompletion , great refactoring tools
8) Decorator syntax shown with @ symbol
9) with new Decorator syntax we get new improved dependency injection
10) no controllers we now have components and directives
    a) each controller will have a view and javascript class
11) For new components we will have new component router to able to wire  all of our component together
12) in Angular 2 we can use ES6 modules which is great because in Angular 1 there was no way we could asynchronously load modules without doing some hacky things
    now we can load a little part of application on initial load on next route we can load the next part of applicationwithout loading whole application
13) exciting things like JSPm and WebPAck
